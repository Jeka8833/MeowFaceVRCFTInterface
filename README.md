# MeowFaceVRCFTInterface Module

> This module is an unofficial enhancement of the official [VRCFaceTracking-MeowFace](https://github.com/regzo2/VRCFaceTracking-MeowFace) module.

The module is a bridge between the [MeowFace](https://suvidriel.itch.io/meowface) Android app and the [VRCFaceTracking](https://docs.vrcft.io/) app.

With this module you will be able to control your character's face in VRChat using your real face.

The MeowFaceVRCFTInterface is a good starting point as it doesn't require you to invest any money if you have an Android phone (Or its emulation) and a Windows computer.
